Welcome to my website!

My name is Anastassia Kornilova. I am a research scientist at [FiscalNote](https://www.fiscalnote.com/). I spend my days using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Data Science to create insights for legislative and regulatory data. I've even written a couple of [papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Iys4zlsAAAAJ&hl=en) about it. My favorite part of my job is figuring out how to apply new techniques in the field to real-world problems; it is important to understand the trade-offs between using state-of-the-art models and a method that is reliable and easy for a client to understand.

I am, also, interested in learning science and teaching. Recently, I taught a workshop at DC's [TechRebalanced](https://techladyhackathon.org/) and gave a lightning talk at the [Data Science Meetup](https://www.google.com/search?q=data+science+meetup&oq=data+science+meetup&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.3314j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). Reach out to me, if you would like for me to talk about my research or NLP in general at your next event. Check out my blog posts for some of the topics that I can talk about.

Previously, I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a Bachelor in Computer Science and a minor in Language Technologies. I've, also, interned at Pinterest and Khan Academy.

Outside of computers, I love [photography](https://www.instagram.com/azazello_captured/), rock climbing and traveling (to both mountains and cities).

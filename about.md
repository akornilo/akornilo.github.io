Hello! 

My name is Anastassia Kornilova. I am a research scientist (fancier name for a data scientist) at [FiscalNote](https://www.fiscalnote.com/). I spend my days building Machine Learning models and other analytics on legislative data. As an example, I recently published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08182) at [ACL](https://www.aclweb.org/portal/) on predicting how legislators will vote on bills.

Previously, I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a Bachelor in Computer Science and a minor in Language Technologies. I've, also, interned at Pinterest and Khna Acedemy.

I am in interested in language, machine learning, psychology and education. All of these tie back to my fascination with learning: in machines, in schools, in brains...

The purpose of this blog is to share cool technical topics in an approachable way. This will give me a chance to practice explaining cool technical topics and solidify my own understanding of these areas. 

Outside of computers, I love [photography](https://www.instagram.com/azazello_captured/), rock climbing and traveling (to both mountains and cities).

I'm a senior in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University (just finished studying abroad in Edinburgh). As a former Khan Academy, Pinterest and Square intern, I worked on on various Data Science/Infrastructure teams. 
I am in interested in language technologies, machine learning, neuroscience and education. All of these tie back to my fascination with learning: in machines, in schools, in brains...

The purpose of this blog is to share cool technical topics in an approachable way. This will give me a chance to practice explaining cool technical topics and solidify my own understanding of these areas. 

Outside of computers, I love to capture the world through photography. Check out some my work [here](http://www.viewbug.com/member/meowninja)!

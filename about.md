Rising senior in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon. Former Square, Pinterest and Khan Academy intern. My passions are for [computational semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_semantics) and educational technology. Both of these tie back to my fascination with learning: in machines, in schools and in brains.

The purpose of this blog is to share cool technical topics in an approachable way. This will give me a chance to experiment with technical learning experiences, share cool information and solidify my own understanding of these areas.

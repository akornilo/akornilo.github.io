I'm a senior in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon (currently studying abroad in Ediburgh). As a former Khan Academy, Pinterest and Square intern I worked on on various Data Science/Infrastructure teams. My current passions are for [language technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_technology) and [educational technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_technology). Both of these tie back to my fascination with learning: in machines, in schools, in brains....

The purpose of this blog is to share cool technical topics in an approachable way. This will give me a chance to experiment with technical learning experiences, share cool information and solidify my own understanding of these areas. Sometimes, I may write about other ideas and experiences, too.

Outside of computers, I love to capture the world through photography. Check out some my work [here](http://www.viewbug.com/member/meowninja)!

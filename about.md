I've recently graduated from Carnegie Mellon University (with a brief stint in Edinburgh) with a Computer Science degree. As a former Khan Academy and Pinterest intern, I got to work on data science in a variety of contexts. My journey continues at FiscalNote, where I will be playing with NLP on the research team.

I am in interested in language, machine learning, psychology and education. All of these tie back to my fascination with learning: in machines, in schools, in brains...

The purpose of this blog is to share cool technical topics in an approachable way. This will give me a chance to practice explaining cool technical topics and solidify my own understanding of these areas. 

Outside of computers, I love [photography](http://www.viewbug.com/member/meowninja), swing dance and traveling (to both mountains and cities).

My name is Anastassia Kornilova. I am a research scientist at [FiscalNote](https://www.fiscalnote.com/). I spend my days using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Data Science to create insights for legislative and regulatory data. I've even written a couple of [papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Iys4zlsAAAAJ&hl=en) about it. I love figuring out how to apply new technology to real-world problems. Specifically, I am interested in balancing the trade-offs between using state-of-the-art models and simple-and-fast methods that are easy to interpret (we can't always have it all ;) )
 
My real passion is for education and teaching. In the past, I have given tutorials and talks for DC's [TechRebalanced](https://techladyhackathon.org/), Data Science Meetup and WIML/DS. Listen to me talk about [Natural Language Processing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2U8AY6Roww&list=PLVcEZG2JPVhf53CtEMEsaoRVNCqwpJ-5U&index=34) and [SpaCy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5BcSKEC19o) online. Reach out to me, if you would like for me to talk about my research or NLP in general at your next event. Check out my blog posts for some of the topics that I can talk about.

Previously, I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a Bachelor in Computer Science and a minor in Language Technologies. I've, also, interned at Pinterest and Khan Academy.

Outside of technology, I love [photography](https://www.instagram.com/azazello_captured/), rock climbing and traveling (to both mountains and cities).

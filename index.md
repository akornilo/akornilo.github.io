My name is Anastassia Kornilova. I am a research scientist at [FiscalNote](https://www.fiscalnote.com/). I spend my days using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Data Science to create insights for legislative and regulatory data. I've even written a couple of [papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Iys4zlsAAAAJ&hl=en) about it. I love figuring out how to apply new technology to real-world problems. Specifically, I am interested in balancing the trade-offs between using state-of-the-art models and simple-and-fast methods that are easy to interpret. 
 
My real passion is for education and teaching. In the past, I have given tutorials and talks for DC's [TechRebalanced](https://techladyhackathon.org/), Data Science Meetup and WIML/DS. Listen to me talk about [Natural Language Processing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2U8AY6Roww&list=PLVcEZG2JPVhf53CtEMEsaoRVNCqwpJ-5U&index=34) and [SpaCy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5BcSKEC19o) online. Reach out to me, if you would like for me to talk about NLP or ML your next event. 

Previously, I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a Bachelor in Computer Science and a Minor in Language Technologies. I've, also, interned at Pinterest and Khan Academy.

Outside of technology, I love [photography](https://www.instagram.com/azazello_captured/), rock climbing and traveling (to both mountains and cities).
